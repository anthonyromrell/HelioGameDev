Project Overview

Spark Dash

You are a spark losing power while traveling down a broken twisted/braided powerline. You can bounce between different braids to travel further down the line. Some lines will have power running through them allowing you to regain power. Traveling on non powered braids will sap some of your energy, How ever travling over a break in a line will sap half of your remaining energy.
